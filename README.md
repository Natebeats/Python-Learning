Programming Learning (Python) 20.02 
## Status:
- Motivation: high
- Knowledge Python: Intermediate+
- Knowledge of Java: intermediate

## Comment:
Learning quickly but confidence in skill goes down occasionally because there is so much to learn and internalize.
I feel like the second phase of the Dunning-Kruger effect is hitting me hard and I hardly can't do exercises without looking up some information.

Everything Java is from my class and it is not my preferred language

My primary focus is on Python.
It's all self-taught.

Update: 20.09.2025

I've been in an Intership the last 5 months.
My Project was develop modules for Odoo 17 Enterprise for inhouse use.
Since the firm split with the non profit Org. we have been looking for ways to export the Systems and Data and landed on Odoo 17 Enterprise, because its Open source and higly flexible.
My first Module was about Device and Key Administration, it went fairly well, but i needed those 5 month to polish it.
I also mad some QoL changes in the Projects module, mostly QoL changes and some extra datafields.

Privately I've been working on an Web Application for Chord progression creation.
mere infos in the Read me
Its a fairly big Project and i try to get it done for publication.
