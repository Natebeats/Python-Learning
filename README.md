Programming Learning (Python) 20.02 
## Status:
- Motivation: high
- Knowledge Python: Intermediate+
- Knowledge of Java: intermediate

## Comment:
Learning quickly but confidence in skill goes down occasionally because there is so much to learn and internalize.
I feel like the second phase of the Dunning-Kruger effect is hitting me hard and I hardly can't do exercises without looking up some information.

Everything Java is from my class and it is not my preferred language

My primary focus is on Python.
It's all self-taught.
